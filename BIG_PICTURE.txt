Bugs in lfpa and family. 

Have the bugs now been demoted to leaks?

Then debug glibc with arena number? 

Then build a glibc with the elfht rather than the metadata ...

Nice metadata free malloc.

Conjectures:

If a descriptor  is in the Partial queue of a sizeclass, then it is not the Partial superblock
of any heap.

If a descriptor is the Active superblock of a heap, then freeing from the descriptor will
never make it EMPTY.

Thus either the removal of a FULL active descriptor or the act of freeing the first block from it
must refudge the counts, so that it can beocome EMOTY.

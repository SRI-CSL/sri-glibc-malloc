0.[X] Figure out a good way to make sure the lfht_t is initialized.
(I guess we wil need an initialization routine after all).

1.[X] Fix AllocNewSB to actually handle the alignment argument.

Question 4 All: The algorithm used in arena.c looks to be somewhat contentious. 
(Paying attention to the static global aligned_heap_area). Discuss.
But do we want to pay the fragmentation price?

2.[X]  Add new SuperBlocks to the desc_tbl.

3.[X]  Manage mmapped memory via mmap_tbl.

4.[X]  Write pointer2SuperBlock

5.[X] Get to a twinned state.

6.[X]  Stress test in a multithreaded multicore environment.

7.[X] Eliminate the metadata.


8. Grow (and shrink) the tables.


9.[X] Clean up the dodgey code that came from the maged implementation.


10.[X] Tune it somewhat.


11. Use FIFO queues of decriptors rather than LIFO queues.


12. Ditch the 128 CAS for just 64 CAS.


===========================

frolloc gets 8, 11, and 12.

then glibc gets debug 

glibc?


TO DO LIST:


get lifo_queue back down to 64, then bring in fifo 64 and
get the switch hitting going.
 
get the lfpa back down from cas_128 to cas_64

struct { ... } active;

struct { ... } descriptor_queue; 

see if we can get a simple lfht that only locks when growing.

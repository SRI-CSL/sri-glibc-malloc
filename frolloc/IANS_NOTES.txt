0[X]. Figure out a good way to make sure the lfht_t is initialized.
(I guess we wil need an initialization routine after all).

1[X]. Fix AllocNewSB to actually handle the alignment argument.
Need to debug it, getting alignment crashes.

Question 4 All: The algorithm used in arena.c looks to be somewhat contentious. 
(Paying attention to the static global aligned_heap_area). Discuss.
But do we want to pay the fragmentation price?

2.[X]  Add new SuperBlocks to the desc_tbl. Still need to remove them...

3.[X]  Manage mmapped memory via mmap_tbl.

4. Write pointer2SuperBlock

5. Get to a twinned state.

6. Eliminate the metadata.

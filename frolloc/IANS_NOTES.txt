0[X]. Figure out a good way to make sure the lfht_t is initialized.
(I guess we wil need an initialization routine after all).

Question 4 All: I need help with:

static inline void init_sizeclasses(void)

in malloc_internals.h.


1[X]. Fix AllocNewSB to actually handle the alignment argument.
Need to check it, also need to see what sizeof(descriptor) is.

Question 4 All: The algorithm used in arena.c looks to be somewhat contentious. 
(Paying attention to the static global aligned_heap_area). Discuss.
But do we want to pay the fragmentation price?

2. Add new SuperBlocks to the lfht.

3. Decide what to do with mmapped memory.

4. Write pointer2SuperBlock

5. Get to a twinned state.

6. Eliminate the metadata.

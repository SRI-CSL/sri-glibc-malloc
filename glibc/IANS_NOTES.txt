Plan of Attack 

Based on the approach taken for psmalloc.

0. get av->top under control

1. twin data with metadata

2. get metadata to agree with the data

3. bins need to become chunkinfoptrs not mchunkptrs

4. all the _int_ routines need chunkinfoptrs args

5. trim the metadata stored in mchunkptrs (the linked lists)

6. last remainder etc

7. only store arena numbers in mchunkptr

8. remove the sharing of the header and footer




Memory Exhaustion Design

We need to improve the psmalloc2 design so that we can recover
from memory exhaustion, specifically when we need to create metadata.

The idea would be that prior to any memory allocation
the necessary new metadata would be preallocated.

Say as part of the arena.

1. hooks.  NEEDS TESTING!!

2. cache. NEEDS TESTING!!

3. issue #5. memory pool optimization.

14[X]. FIXMES

4. the (old and now inaccurate) code comments need to be trimmed.

3. I use some stdatomics in arena.c which should prolly use glibc atomics.


========

To push this upstream we need to eliminate prev_size with pointers
to the next_md and prev_md.


Memory Exhaustion Design

We need to improve the psmalloc2 design so that we can recover
from memory exhaustion, specifically when we need to create metadata.

The idea would be that prior to any memory allocation
the necessary new metadata would be preallocated.

Say as part of the arena.

chunkinfoptr  md_pool[4];


=========

Other Ideas.

The pool allocator for the metadata could be a trimmed down maged michael
version, since there are only two sizes. Might have to think this through
carefully, since our pool allocator is designed with Larsen's hashtable 
in mind...


Need to write a fair bit of commentary in the code, especially in the 
metadata code.

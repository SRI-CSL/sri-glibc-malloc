Need to understand this better!

Q1. When do superblocks migrate from heap to heap?

Q2. How does the descriptor queue work, and why is the
implementation partial?





==============
Overview:


- an anchor stores the "fullness" of a superblock:
     * avail
     * count
     * state
     * tag    (for the aba problem)

- a descriptor stores the global state of a superblock
     * anchor
     * Next (a pointer to the "Next" superblock)
     * sb   (the actual superblock)
     * heap (the heap that owns the superblock)
     * sz   (the size of the blocks in the superblock)
     * maxcount  (the total number of blokc in the superblock)

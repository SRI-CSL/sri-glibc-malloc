1. mmapped memory is not associated with an arena, but we will need to
put it's metadata somewhere... that could make the lookup function a
bit ugly... since given a chunk we do not really know if it is mmapped
until we see it metadata, and to find it's metadata ....

have a bad feeling that any solution is going to involve locks ...

for example we could put all mmapped memory in the main arena.
then when we use

arena_for_chunk(ptr)

that is based on

heap_for_ptr(ptr)

we need to find out that this is not an arena in our cyclic list.
but touching that list requires the lock :-(

one possibility that we mentioned in the designfest meeting was to
retain some innocuous metadata such as this.
